""" Write a program to assume an integer and find whether the given number is large or small than the given input. If the number is above or below the user input throw the user-defined exception as “Value is Small” or “Value is large”. If it matches with the user assumption display the message as “Well Done”. This process should be continued till the user prompts the symbol $. 

Input format :
The first line of the input consists of the value to be assumed.

The next input is the value to be checked.

The last input is the choice. (Exit if the user entered $).

Output format :
The output prints the suitable exception or message.
